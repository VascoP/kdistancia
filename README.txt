The Kdistancia (how far) is an application to check the distance of customized routes 
made in walks on foot, bicycle or other. 
The purpose of the application are the situations in that a GPS device for real-time capturing was not 
available in training, or so we can check the distance of a given route before actually going through it. 
For non customized routes (eg distance from street A to street B) mapas.sapo.pt's own 
service already does a good job with estimates using various means of transport. 
The application uses the API and features of mapas.sapo.pt
